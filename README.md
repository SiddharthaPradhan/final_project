# Final Project

For your final project, you'll implement a web application that exhibits understanding of the course materials. 
This project should provide an opportunity to both be creative and to pursue individual research and learning goals.

## General description
Your project should consist of a complete Web application, exhibiting facets of the three main sections of the course material:

- Static web page content and design. You should have a project that is accessible, easily navigable, and features significant content.
- Dynamic behavior implemented with JavaScript (TypeScript is also allowed if your group wants to explore it).
- Server-side programming *using Node.js*. Typically this will take the form of some sort of persistent data (database), authentication, and possibly server-side computation. 
- A video (less than five minutes) where each group member explains some aspect of the project. An easy way to produce this video is for you all the groups members to join a Zoom call that is recorded; each member can share their screen when they discuss the project or one member can "drive" the interface while other members narrate (this second option will probably work better.) The video should be posted on YouTube or some other accessible video hosting service. Make sure your video is less than five minutes, but long enough to successfully  explain your project and show it in action. There is no minimum video length.

#### Proposal (due 9/27) 
Provide an outline of your project direction and the names of associated team members. 
The outline should have enough detail so that staff can determine if it meets the minimum expectations, or if it goes too far to be reasonable by the deadline. Please include a general description of a project, and list of key technologies/libraries you plan on using (e.g. React, Three.js, Svelte, TypeScript etc.). Two to four paragraps should provide enough level of detail. Name the file proposal.md and submit a pull request by Tuesday, September 27th at 11:59 PM (end of day). Only one pull request is required per team.

There are no other scheduled checkpoints for your project.
